# TravelBuddy
TravelBuddy is a portal for people looking for organised experience tours at locations around the world. It also allows people providing such an experience to become a part of the TravelBuddy community and have an exposure on the site with their programme, pricing and lengths of the tours.

## Features
### Existing Features
The site welcomes the user with an effective call to action and the list of most popular locations directly below. To add credibility to the service I’ve listed a selection of user’s testimonials to make sure new visitors will see TravelBuddy as a trustworthy services and be more inclined to make the first booking.
Each available tour has its own separate page where I list the price, duration, short description and list of attraction. I’ve also included a selection of photos to help a user to make a booking.
I’ve also included a separate page for people wishing to join TravelBuddy as a host. I’ve listed main benefits of becoming a host at TravelBuddy and a registration form to collect the details about the person. I’ve made sure the form has couple of required fields to avoid sending incomplete submissions.
The last page of the portal is the contact page where I provide a simple query form and a fictional office location marked on Google Maps in Dublin.
### Features Left to Implement
Once I become accustomed to using Python with its frameworks I’d like to create a true travel hosting portal with user registrations, members logins and search functionality. 
## Technologies Used
The site is built using HTML and CSS. It is based on Bootstrap framework.
## Testing
The site was tested thoroughly using main browsers: Google Chrome, Mozilla Firefox, Apple Safari and MS Edge using built in Developer Tools. I’ve tested all simulated devices (mobile phones, tablets) and large desktop windows. I’ve also tested the site using various physical devices - iPhone 11, Samsung Galaxy Prime, iPad Pro and various desktop computers (iMac, MacBook and Windows PC). I’ve used flexible units (em, rem, %) to make sure the site scales properly without using too many media queries in my stylesheet.
The site was validated using both HTML and CSS validators and all pages passed the tests successfully.
## Deployment
The site is hosted at GitHub pages, using directly the master branch.  In order to make the pages visible on GitHub pages I had to turn on the function at the Settings tab inside my repository. The site is being updated automatically each time there’s a new commit uploaded. 
In case somebody wishes to clone the repository it can be done with by downloading the zip file containing the whole repository or use `git clone  https://github.com/redlik/travelbuddy.git` command in the terminal window.
## Credits
The site content was created especially for the purpose of the project with a help from friend of mine, Sean Powers, the owner of [Irish Experience Tour][8].
